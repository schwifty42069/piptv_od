piptv_od - piptv on demand!
=================================

This script contains a simple custom IMDB query class that works in conjunction with a VidSource API wrapper class, a mass query class and media download class. 
That means the links it produces can be "streamed" from the source, or fed into the media downloader class to be written to your disk. This is not a complete script, it is
basically a series of utility classes that haven't been integrated into a full application yet. I will update this as I work on it!
